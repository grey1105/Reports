# Reports
Crytica Reporting Web App
Created by GR

As we near Beta testing on our probing software. We needed an UX interface for reporting software. At its basic form, we can pull data from mySQL server and create simple charts. 
*Have a calendar that displays dates with data.
*Scripts to chunk given date into 15 min interval chunks to better view the data
*Have 6 different reports to gaugue probe scan performance
